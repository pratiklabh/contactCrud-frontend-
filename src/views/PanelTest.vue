/*
1) Reactivity Issues:
    If the state that controls the panel header is reactive and changes unexpectedly, it might cause the header to vanish.
    This can happen if the data or prop driving the header content is updated unexpectedly, causing the panel to re-render without the header.

2) DOM Updates:
    If you're manipulating the DOM directly (e.g., using JavaScript to hide/show elements) or triggering frequent updates (e.g., by reactive properties),
    it might cause the panel header to disappear temporarily during those updates.

3) CSS Animations/Transitions:
    Sometimes, animations or transitions applied to the panel or its parent container might cause visual glitches,
    making the header appear to "vanish." Check if there are CSS transitions, animations, or complex layouts that could cause this behavior.

4) Rendering Lag:
    If your panel has dynamic content (like lazy-loaded data or API requests), there could be a delay or a race condition that
    temporarily removes the header when the panel re-renders. Ensure that any asynchronous data fetching or rendering is properly managed to avoid this.

5) Z-index/Overflow Issues:
    The panel header might be getting hidden behind another element due to improper z-index stacking or overflow settings of a parent container.
    Inspect the layout to ensure that no other element is covering the header.

6) Component Lifecycle:
    If the panel is being mounted or unmounted frequently due to Vue's lifecycle hooks or conditional rendering,
    the header might flicker or disappear. Ensure proper handling of v-if or v-show conditions related to the panel.
